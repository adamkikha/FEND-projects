## Introduction
The starter project has all HTML and CSS styling needed for the page.

the goal is to enhance node and JS skills by adding some dynamic features to the page.

## Tasks
- get weather data dynamically by zip code from an external API.
- save the data to the app on the server side.
- updating the website UI with the data on the app.

These tasks required good understanding of DOM fundamentals , nodejs , http 
requests and async JS.

## Usage
In addition to being a very good exercise for all-around web dev knowledge,

this project layout can be used as a simple weather journal , mixing user input
with actual weather data.
