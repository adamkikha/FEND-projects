## Introduction
The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project.

the goal is to enhance HTML & CSS and JS skills by adding some dynamic features to the page.

## Tasks
- Add a navigation bar dynamically based on number of sections.
- Adding functionality to navigation items 
by making them scroll to appropriate section.
- Assigning `.your-active-class` dynamically based on 
which section is in the viewport

These tasks required some manipulation of HTML and CSS in addition to
good understanding of JS and DOM fundamentals 

## Usage
In addition to being a very good exercise for all-around web dev knowledge,

this project layout can be used as a simple CMS template with basic user interactivity which can be enhanced even further.
